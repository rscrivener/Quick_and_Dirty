<b>Quick&Dirty</b>

 You can find a working exsample in the "Quick&Dirty" folder, this folder includes:
	<br>- A "jQuery" folder for 'jQuery.js'
	<br>- A "Templates" folder to store all templates, right now it includes some of the standard HTML elements. I will update it when I get more time and have a need for it.
	<br>- A "Renderer" folder which contains 'Renderer.js' which the the file that does all the rendering of the webpage. This file is where most of the issues will be located.
	<br>- A 'index.html' file that contains a small demo of how to use Quick&Dirty.
	
<b>Why Quick&Dirty </b>

I choose the name Quick&Dirty becuase I thought it was amusing and true, as drawing up webpages in JavaScript looks really dirty, but allows for alot of flexability.
